# libft_2.0

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. For this project we have to re-write those functions,
understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help me for all the future C
projects in the 42 Curriculum.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Part One of the project is to recode the following list of system functions:

```
memset
bzero
memcpy
memccpy
memmove
memchr
memcmp
strlen - The strlen() function checks the length of the string.
strdup
strcpy
strncpy
strcat
strncat
strlcat
strchr
strrchr
strstr
strnstr
strcmp
strncmp
atoi
isalpha
isdigit
isalnum
isascii
isprint
toupper
tolower
```

Part two of the project is to recode the following functions. Most of these functions are not in the built in the system but will be needed for future projects.

```
ft_memalloc
ft_memdel
ft_strnew
ft_strdel
ft_strclr
ft_striter
ft_striteri
ft_strmap
ft_strmapi
ft_strequ
ft_strnequ
ft_strsub
ft_strjoin
ft_strtrim
ft_strsplit
ft_itoa
ft_putchar - The ft_putchar() function puts a single character in stdout
ft_putstr - The ft_putstr() function works similar to ft_putchar but allows to put a whole string instead of a single character
ft_putendl
ft_putnbr
ft_putchar_fd
ft_putstr_fd
ft_putendl_fd
ft_putnbr_fd
```

### Running the tests

In order to compile the Library you will need to run the Makefile in order to do that run

```
make
```

once compiled you will run the function that you want to try out by editing the main.c file

```
gcc main.c libft.a
```

execute the file

```
./a.out
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
