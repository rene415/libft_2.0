# libft_2.0

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. For this project we have to re-write those functions,
understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help me for all the future C
projects in the 42 Curriculum.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Part One of the project is to recode the following list of system functions:

```
memset - he memset() function writes len bytes of value c (converted to an unsigned char) to the string b.
bzero - The bzero() function writes n zeroed bytes to the string s.  If n is zero, bzero() does nothing.
memcpy - The memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dst.
memccpy
memmove
memchr
memcmp
strlen - The strlen() function computes the length of the string s.
strdup
strcpy
strncpy
strcat
strncat
strlcat
strchr
strrchr
strstr
strnstr
strcmp
strncmp
atoi
isalpha
isdigit
isalnum
isascii
isprint
toupper
tolower
```

### Running

In order to compile the Library you will need to run the Makefile in order to do that run

```
make
```

once compiled you will run the function that you want to try out by editing the main.c file

```
gcc main.c libft.a
```

execute the file

```
./a.out
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
